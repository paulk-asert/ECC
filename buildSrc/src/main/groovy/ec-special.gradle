// Some DGM methods override Eclipse Collection methods. This build config disables such methods.
// In numerous cases, the Groovy override would be acceptable since it possibly has similar semantics.
// Here however, we also care about returning the same Java types for easy comparison with Java behavior.
// E.g. ImmutableList#groupBy and DGM#groupBy return equivalent maps
// but the former returns ImmutableListMultimap whereas the latter returns LinkedHashMap.
